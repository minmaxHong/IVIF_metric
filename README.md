# Evaluation-for-VIF
Quantitative evaluation for visible  and infrared image fusion.
<br/>Additionally, this code is a refactored version of the Awesome-Image-Fusion code [Awesome-Image-Fusion](https://github.com/GeoVectorMatrix/Awesome-Image-Fusion)


# Inference
You can set the paths for the ir, vi, and fused folders in the Evaluation_for_Single_Image.m file, and then run the code below.

```Shell
Evaluation_for_Single_Image.m
```
